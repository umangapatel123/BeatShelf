# Assumption

The name of the website is BEATSHELF

## Design and Layout: 
The base interface of the web portal is designed using HTML and CSS to create static web pages that display information about artists, albums, and songs.

## Static Content: 
The content displayed on the web pages, including artist information, album details, and song information, are static and will not have any dynamic or real-time updates. The content is provided as static text and images, and there is no requirement for user-generated content or data input.

## Browser Compatibility: 
The web portal is assumed to be designed to be compatible with modern web browsers, including but not limited to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. Compatibility with older or less commonly used web browsers is not considered as a requirement.

We have made a Album Page that has 5 Album of each artist from where we can go to Album page of individual Artists by clicking on Artist image/name
and on clicking an album on an artist's page we go to it's corresponding page.

We have also made song page for each Album by clicking on any album throughout our website (i.e in Album page or Album page of each Artist OR Homepage ) User can to to this page 

In future we plan to make the page responsive by allowing the users to give the ratings to different songs and update the top charts accordingly

We also plan to add a comment section to the artist's album page for the users

We also plan to include sign in and sign up pages for which we have included respective buttons on navigation bar

For best experience the recommended screen size would be 1920 x 1080
